This is a test
1. Create a Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., "dnd-maps"). It can be public or private.

2. Get a Token: Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic). Generate a new token with the 'repo' scope checked. Copy it immediately!

3. Configure the Tool:

Token: Paste your PAT here.
Repo: Enter your username/repo-name.
Path: Enter map-data.json.
4. Share with Players: After you sync for the first time, your data will be at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[USER]/[REPO]/main/map-data.json
Give this URL to your players for them to load in Player Mode!
